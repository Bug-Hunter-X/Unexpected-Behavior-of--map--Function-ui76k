# Swift `map` Function Behavior

This example demonstrates the behavior of the `map` function in Swift.  Unlike some other languages, Swift's `map` function returns a *new* array containing the transformed elements, leaving the original array unchanged.

This behavior can lead to unexpected results if you're expecting the original array to be modified in place.
